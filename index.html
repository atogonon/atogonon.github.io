				<p>Hi! I'm Alvin Togonon and welcome to my website!  I am a former biomedical engineer turned full stack software engineer based in New Jersey.  I graduated with my degree in biomedical engineering in 2009 and have worked as an analyst/project manager/research scientist/engineer for a couple of great companies in the years since.  I am grateful to have met some great people during that time and was able learn and grow as an engineer alongside them, but I always had programming in the back of my head.  I was part of that generation that taught ourselves how to code just to make our blogs look cool (remember Xanga and MySpace?), so I knew that at some point I wanted to jump back in.  In the summer of 2019, I had the opportunity to take the leap and enrolled at Fullstack Academy.  Having completed their full stack software engineering immersive, I was able to learn and develop the skills I need to start my new career in tech.  During my time there, I  was able to work on some very cool stuff and you can find a couple of things I was able to build in the 'Projects' section below.</p>

				<p>When I'm not coding, I'm all about gaming (both videogames and tabletop), comics & superhero movies (I've seen all of the MCU movies), and pretty much anything associated with geek culture.  I'm also a huge basketball (Broooooooklyn!) and football (Go Hawks!) fan.  So even if you don't want to talk shop with coding and instead want to talk about rolling dice at a D&D table, why Batman can beat Superman(yes he totally can), or who you think is going to win the next NBA title, feel free to drop me a line!</p>

				<p><b>Skills:</b>
					<br/>Proficient in Javascript, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, React, & Redux
					<br/>Familiar with C++, Java, Heroku, GraphQL, Prisma, Apollo, Mocha, Chai, Viro AR, & React Native

					<h3>Spray-R</h3>

					<br/>
					Spray-R is an AR app that allows users to draw on surfaces in augmented reality using your mobile device as the spray-can. Users can also save their drawings and download drawings from other users. This project was built using React Native, Viro AR, Redux, Node.js and Express.
					<br/><br/>
					This was my capstone project that I worked on alongside my teammates David Sanvicente, Colin Kim, and Edward Lu. Let me tell you, this project was a lot of fun to work on.  I loved working with these guys and I feel that our chemistry really helped us to power through any issues or blockers that we faced along the way.  None of had previous experience working with AR technology before, so being on the same page made it easier for us to put our heads together to learn the tech and put it together with what we know to make the app.

					<h3>The Yawning Portal</h3>
					The Yawning Portal is a web portal that allows Dungeons and Dragons players to record and share notes for the campaigns they are playing in. The aim is to provide functionality that supports creating campaigns, creating and sharing notes within a campaign and the ability for users to share their characters and stats. This project was built using GraphQL, Prisma, Apollo and React.
					<br/><br/>
					Sorry, no video demo for this one!  This project was something I got to work on solo over a couple of days and I definitely plan to make additions and improvements in the future!  I wanted to make something related to one of my hobbies so the aim was to build something similar to Roll20 or DnD Beyond, starting at a basic level.  The nature of the project turned out to be very CRUD based, so I took this as an opportunity to teach myself GraphQL instead of just using the backend technologies we learned at Fullstack.
